## Register Juror

Every person has to register for an [account](account.md) in the system in general.

### Juror application

Everyone who wants to be a juror at the tournament has to apply as juror. Even if you are already team leader.

Please  **apply to tournament** directly on the [**Registration - My Applications**](/registration/list) page. Select *apply as possible juror*. The application is then reviewed by the organisers and if approved, adds the role of possible juror to your attendance. Continue to apply as a participating role.

If you plan to be a team leader you can apply as team leder to your team. Otherwise you can apply as experienced juror. This has to be reviewed again by the organisers.
Being a possible juror alone does not qualify you to attend the tournament.

### Application Data

After you obtained a participating role, you have to enter additional participation dependent data.
